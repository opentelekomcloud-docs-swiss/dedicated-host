Overview
========

Welcome to *Dedicated Host API Reference*. Dedicated Host (DeH) provides dedicated physical hosts for you. You can create ECSs on a DeH to enhance isolation, security, and performance of your ECSs. When you migrate services to a DeH, you can continue to use your server software licenses used before the migration. That is, you can use the Bring Your Own License (BYOL) feature on the DeH to independently manage your ECSs.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on DeHs, such as creating, querying, deleting, and modifying DeHs. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <deh_03_0000>`.

If you plan to access DeHs through an API, ensure that you are familiar with DeH concepts. For details, see "Service Overview" in the *Dedicated Host User Guide*.
